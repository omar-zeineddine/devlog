> Developers spend a lot of time trying to achieve a goal, fixing a bug, or refactoring code

> The idea behind Devlog is to be the go to place for devs, a place where they can write down their thoughts, or document their latest ideas around a community that share their same interests

Reasons why developers should blog:

- blog posts are a great medium for developers to learn and share their ideas
- blogs are a way to staying up to date in the continuously evolving tech space
- writing based around technical words isn't always easy task, blogging can improve a developers writing and communication skills
